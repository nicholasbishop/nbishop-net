<h2>gpt-disk-rs</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Split the <code>Guid</code> type out of <code>gpt_disk_types</code> and into its own crate:
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/uguid"><code>uguid</code></a>. The existing GUID crates
don't quite do the same thing, and since the <code>Guid</code> type is pretty
broadly useful (UEFI, GPT, Microsoft Windows) I think it's good to
have it in its own crate so it can easily be reused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Released a version 0.6.0 of <code>uguid</code> that adds a const
<code>Guid::to_ascii_hex_lower</code> method and an optional <code>serde</code> feature for
serializing and deserializing stringified <code>Guids</code>.
<a href="https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/blob/main/uguid/CHANGELOG.md#060">Changelog</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>uefi-rs</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quick <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/444">PR</a> to fix the
CI after <code>clap</code> deprecated a bunch of stuff. That fix was quickly
superceded by a
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/445">better one</a> though.</p>
<p>I think what <code>clap</code> tried to do with smoothing the upgrade path via
deprecations was a reasonable and interesting experiment, but
ultimately it clearly didn't work out because too many projects don't
want to see such warnings, even if non-fatal. I guess maybe a better
upgrade guide could have helped, but in the end it doesn't seem like
there's much advantage there over just waiting until a major version
bump to make the change without using deprecations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
