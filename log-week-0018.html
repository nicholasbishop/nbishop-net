<ul>
<li>
<p>Quick <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/444">PR</a> to fix the
CI after <code>clap</code> deprecated a bunch of stuff. That fix was quickly
superceded by a
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/445">better one</a> though.</p>
<p>I think what <code>clap</code> tried to do with smoothing the upgrade path via
deprecations was a reasonable and interesting experiment, but
ultimately it clearly didn't work out because too many projects don't
want to see such warnings, even if non-fatal. I guess maybe a better
upgrade guide could have helped, but in the end it doesn't seem like
there's much advantage there over just waiting until a major version
bump to make the change without using deprecations.</p>
