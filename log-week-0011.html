<h2>uefi-rs</h2>
<ul>
<li>While working on adding some more unit tests I found some undefined
behavior using Miri. Filed an
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/406">issue</a>.</li>
<li>Put up a <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/407">PR</a> to
partially fix that UB, by avoiding use of <code>allocate_buffer</code> in the
file info code.</li>
<li>Found some potential UB in the file info code with
<code>-Zmiri-tag-raw-pointers</code>, put up a
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/408">PR</a> to fix it.</li>
<li>I'd like to enable <code>-Zmiri-tag-raw-pointers</code> in our Miri tests in
general, but it's catching some issues with <code>DevicePath</code>. This one is
tricky because unlike most protocols, <code>DevicePath</code> is really
unsized. But we don't currently implement it that way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rust</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've been using Miri more in uefi-rs to test our unsafe code, which we
have quite a lot of. One issue I've had is that I find myself guessing
a lot as to what Miri is trying to tell me. The error messages are
relatively terse, and while a lot has been written about stacked
borrows, it's not clear what the best resource to read is. As a first
step to improving this situation I filed an
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/2066">issue</a> in the Miri
repo suggesting adding documentation for Miri's output to the
readme. Even just documenting the notation used in the output would be
a good start.</li>
</ul>
