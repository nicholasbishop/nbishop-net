      <ul>
<li>
<p>Made a couple fixes to the uefi-rs
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/355">PR</a> that re-adds the
exit code check, it's merged now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realized today that I need some vacation, put in for next week off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick doc cleanup <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/358">PR</a>
for the uefi-rs template readme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a look at an
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/73">issue</a> about string
conversion in uefi-rs. Some of the suggested changes have been made,
but there's probably room for more conversion utilities and code
cleanup. There's also quite a bit of discussion about improvements to
<code>Write</code>ing UCS-2 strings, but I'm not clear on how necessary that is.</p>
<p>I realized <code>CStr16::as_string</code> isn't needed since <code>to_string</code> is
already automatically implemented, put up a
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/357">PR</a> to remove it.</p>
<p>Now looking at removing some of the implicit conversions in the file
system code. I've half convinced myself there's a bug in some unsafe
code in <code>NamedFileProtocolInfo</code>, will have to check that more
carefully. I might start by adding some more tests for the file code,
since it looks like a lot of it isn't yet covered by uefi-test-runner.</p>
</li>
