<p>Made a couple fixes to the uefi-rs
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/355">PR</a> that re-adds the
exit code check, it's merged now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realized today that I need some vacation, put in for next week off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick doc cleanup <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/358">PR</a>
for the uefi-rs template readme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a look at an
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/73">issue</a> about string
conversion in uefi-rs. Some of the suggested changes have been made,
but there's probably room for more conversion utilities and code
cleanup. There's also quite a bit of discussion about improvements to
<code>Write</code>ing UCS-2 strings, but I'm not clear on how necessary that is.</p>
<p>I realized <code>CStr16::as_string</code> isn't needed since <code>to_string</code> is
already automatically implemented, put up a
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/357">PR</a> to remove it.</p>
<p>Now looking at removing some of the implicit conversions in the file
system code. I've half convinced myself there's a bug in some unsafe
code in <code>NamedFileProtocolInfo</code>, will have to check that more
carefully. I might start by adding some more tests for the file code,
since it looks like a lot of it isn't yet covered by uefi-test-runner.</p>

<li>
<p>Took a little time to send messages to my senators about the EARN IT
Act, wherein they are once again trying to let law enforcement spy on
any ol' thing without even a pretense of proper oversight. More info
at the
<a href="https://act.eff.org/action/stop-the-earn-it-act-to-save-our-privacy">EFF</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spent a while trying to figure out how to convert from HTML to PDF. I
didn't end up finding a good option. There are plenty of tools that
can do the basics of conversion: pandoc (with various &quot;engines&quot;),
<a href="https://www.princexml.com">Prince</a>, wkhtmltopdf, chrome (with
<code>--headless --print-to-pdf-no-header --print-to-pdf</code>), weasyprint, but
all of these produce somewhat ugly output that doesn't match what the
HTML looks like in the browser. Firefox's print-to-pdf actually
produces very nice output, but as far as I can tell there's no way to
turn off the headers and footers, and there's no way to generate a pdf
from the command line
[<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1407238">bug</a>].</p>
<p>So, for now maybe the best way to generate a PDF is still LaTex, which
I really did not expect to be the case. Fortunately it's a lot easier
to work with LaTex than it used to be thanks to the amazing
<a href="https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic">tectonic</a> project,
but I really wish I could use HTML for this.</p>
<p>I guess the real problem is that the format we really want doesn't
exist: we want the locked formatting and single-file features of PDF,
but without the incredible complexity of the PDF spec.</p>
