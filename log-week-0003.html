<li>
<p>Taking the whole week off from <code>$dayjob</code>. Since we are still in covid
times this will be a staycation, but still very pleasant to have more
time to relax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing to work on updating my resume. After last week's adventures
in HTML → PDF conversion I decided to stick with the LaTeX format of
my resume that I've been using for many years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upstreamed a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/agd5f/linux/-/commit/47e37b572afbf65be138a1bc07441b32df407bf3">small
fix</a>
in Linux for the iMac12,1 backlight. It's only a couple lines of diff,
but it feels nice to fix up some old (but not <em>that</em> old) hardware to
benefit anyone still using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimenting with some kind of consistent buffer API in uefi-rs. A
consistent pattern that comes up a lot is that UEFI has a function to
read data into a buffer (often, but not always, a <code>u8</code> slice), and if
the buffer is not big enough it will return <code>BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</code>. In
some cases we have manually wrapped such functions to provide a more
convenient API that uses a <code>Vec</code> as the buffer so that we can resize
it as needed until it's big enough. Since allocation is optional in
uefi-rs, the latter interface is hidden behind the <code>exts</code> feature.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we had a way to do all that without the manual
boilerplate. I'm experimenting with having a <code>Buffer</code> trait that can
be backed by either an array or a <code>Vec</code>, and seeing how far I can get
with that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One area of uefi-rs that has consistently tripped me up is
<code>uefi::Result</code>, which tries to cleanly separate errors from warnings
(UEFI packs both of these into the <code>EFI_STATUS</code> enum.) I'm going to
write up a proposal to simplify this type and see what people think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RFC for removing <code>uefi::Completion</code> is now up:
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/360">https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/360</a></p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/google-turns-old-macs-pcs-into-chromebooks-with-chrome-os-flex">ChromeOS
Flex</a>
is now publicly announced! We worked very hard on it, please clap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
