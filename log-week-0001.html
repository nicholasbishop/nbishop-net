<li>
<p>Dependabot let me know that there's a new version of jsonwebtoken out,
which <a href="https://github.com/nicholasbishop/github-app-auth/pull/4">affects my github-app-auth crate</a>.
The automatic PR failed because I disabled default features on all the
non-dev dependencies, and some new features need to be enabled.</p>
<p>While I'm in there, thinking I might replace the <code>chrono</code> dep with <code>time</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hmm, turns out that <code>time</code> is actually quite a bit harder to use than
<code>chrono</code>. There's a <a href="https://time-rs.github.io/book/">book</a>, but
currently it's almost complete empty so it's hard to know where to
look in the API.</p>
<p>I've posted a
<a href="https://github.com/time-rs/time/discussions/442">question</a> in the
project's discussion board. I might try putting up some PRs to help
fill in the docs more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A little work on the generator for this site to sort entries from new
to old, and to add created/updated dates to pages. Then promptly
removed the last-updated time, as it's not working correctly when
rendering through github pages for some reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turns out that the github publish action was doing a shallow
clone. Turning it into a full clone fixed the last-modified time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TODO I've had for a while is to look into
<a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree-sitter</a> and find out
what that's all about. I have a personal text editor project called
<a href="https://github.com/nicholasbishop/emma-editor">emma</a>, which I
occasionally work on but is not what one might call
functional. Currently it has some hacky syntax highlighting support
using <a href="https://github.com/trishume/syntect">syntect</a>, but maybe
tree-sitter would be better since the syntax tree could be used for
other operations too.</p>
<p>Something that surprised me is that while tree-sitter seems to have
good support for <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#editing">incremental
editing</a>,
the associated
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter-highlight">tree-sitter-highlight</a>
library does not. There are a couple open threads on it
(<a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/discussions/1530">discussion</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/1540">issue</a>), so
hopefully that API will be improved at some point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put up a uefi-rs <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/353">PR</a>
to add VM tests for Aarch64.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking into adding support for 32-bit x86 UEFI to uefi-rs. The
existing code seems to work fine, so just a matter of updating the
xtask code to understand the <code>ia32</code> target and add it to the CI. The
version of Ubuntu used on the github runner doesn't yet have an ia32
OVMF package, but there are some unofficial nightlies here:
https://github.com/retrage/edk2-nightly. Put up a quick
<a href="https://github.com/retrage/edk2-nightly/pull/3">PR</a> to fix broken
ia32 links in that project's readme.</p>
<p>And here's the <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/354">PR</a>
adding the ia32 target to uefi-rs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovered a mistake I made in an earlier
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/335">PR</a> to replace the
<code>build.py</code> test runner in uefi-rs with a pure-Rust version: the exit
code of qemu is no longer checked. Put up a
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/355">PR</a> to fix
that. Discovered at that point that the old version of qemu (4.2) in
ubuntu-20.04 would crash on exit, fixed by pulling in a PPA to upgrade
qemu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally started working on updating my resume to include the time I've
spent at Google after the <a href="https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/article/Neverware-is-now-part-of-Google-FAQ">Neverware
acquisition</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
