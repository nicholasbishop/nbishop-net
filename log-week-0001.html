      <ul>
<li>
<p>Dependabot let me know that there's a new version of jsonwebtoken out,
which <a href="https://github.com/nicholasbishop/github-app-auth/pull/4">affects my github-app-auth crate</a>.
The automatic PR failed because I disabled default features on all the
non-dev dependencies, and some new features need to be enabled.</p>
<p>While I'm in there, thinking I might replace the <code>chrono</code> dep with <code>time</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hmm, turns out that <code>time</code> is actually quite a bit harder to use than
<code>chrono</code>. There's a <a href="https://time-rs.github.io/book/">book</a>, but
currently it's almost complete empty so it's hard to know where to
look in the API.</p>
<p>I've posted a
<a href="https://github.com/time-rs/time/discussions/442">question</a> in the
project's discussion board. I might try putting up some PRs to help
fill in the docs more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A little work on the generator for this site to sort entries from new
to old, and to add created/updated dates to pages. Then promptly
removed the last-updated time, as it's not working correctly when
rendering through github pages for some reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turns out that the github publish action was doing a shallow
clone. Turning it into a full clone fixed the last-modified time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TODO I've had for a while is to look into
<a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree-sitter</a> and find out
what that's all about. I have a personal text editor project called
<a href="https://github.com/nicholasbishop/emma-editor">emma</a>, which I
occasionally work on but is not what one might call
functional. Currently it has some hacky syntax highlighting support
using <a href="https://github.com/trishume/syntect">syntect</a>, but maybe
tree-sitter would be better since the syntax tree could be used for
other operations too.</p>
<p>Something that surprised me is that while tree-sitter seems to have
good support for <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#editing">incremental
editing</a>,
the associated
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter-highlight">tree-sitter-highlight</a>
library does not. There are a couple open threads on it
(<a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/discussions/1530">discussion</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/1540">issue</a>), so
hopefully that API will be improved at some point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put up a uefi-rs <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/353">PR</a>
to add VM tests for Aarch64.</p>
</li>
</ul>
