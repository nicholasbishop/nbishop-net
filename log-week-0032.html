      <h2>Rust</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101703">PR</a> for adding
UEFI CI got some more comments, updated it to be part of an existing
CI test group. Ran into the issue where old QEMU crashes with OVMF,
but I think it should be fine for this test.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rustup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minor update to my <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/3067">PR</a>
for expanding the toolchain.toml docs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>uefi-rs</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/516">PR</a> to switch back to
latest nightly.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/517">PR</a> to add a CI job
to test building with an older nightly so that we can be more
intentional about when the required nightly version changes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/518">PR</a> to add some
address type aliases and fix the definition of <code>AllocateType</code> on
<code>i686-unknown-uefi</code>.</li>
<li>We got an issue a while ago about better supporting vscode+rust
analyzer. This was something I hadn't thought about before; I don't
use rust-analyzer or any particularly fancy IDE stuff myself. (Just as
a matter of personal preference I don't like when docs pop up over the
code, or red squigglies show up under code that I'm working on, or the
struggle to get it working with any larger project that inevitably has
some kind of custom config.) However, I know others like these tools
so I very much want to support their use case as well as we can. I
spent a little time figuring out how to get vscode+rust analyzer set
up to test it out, and documented some issues I saw and solutions to
some of them:
