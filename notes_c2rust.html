    <h1>Building c2rust</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">« Home</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust">c2rust</a> is a really neat and
useful tool :) Unfortunately I had some difficulty building c2rust,
here are some notes on how I got it to work.</p>
<p>The c2rust build depends on the host environment, so basically you
don't want to build it there or it will break. Building it in a
container is the way to go. The c2rust repo has a docker subdirectory,
but for some reason it just seems to be for setting up a build
environment to build c2rust; it doesn't go all the way and just give
you the binary. And the instructions don't actually say what to do
with the scripts there, at least as far as I can tell (I may have
missed something!), so it's all a bit confusing.</p>
<p>Here's what worked for me on Fedora:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a <code>Containerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-docker">FROM docker://immunant/c2rust:archlinux-base-latest

RUN git clone https://github.com/immunant/c2rust.git
WORKDIR c2rust
RUN cargo +nightly-2019-12-05 build --release --locked

ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/c2rust/target/release/c2rust&quot;]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build it (this will take a while):</p>
<pre><code>podman build -f Containerfile -t c2rust
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run it in the container:</p>
<pre><code>podman run -v$PWD:/host:z c2rust transpile --output-dir /host/transpile/ /host/compile_commands.json
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That last step assumes that you have a <code>compile_commands.json</code> in the
current directory and that the paths it references are under
<code>/host</code>. The output will go to <code>/host/transpile</code>.</p>
