<ul>
<li>A developer contacted me to suggest changing the license from just
Apache-2.0 to Apache-2.0 or MIT. This improves compatibility with
GPLv2 and is in alignment with much of the Rust ecosystem. That change
has now been made and new versions of the crates have been
released. (Took me a few tries to get the license README links
correct, so ended up with a few extra dot releases of <code>uguid</code>, but
should be all good now.)</li>
