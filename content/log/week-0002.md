* Made a couple fixes to the uefi-rs
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/355) that re-adds the
  exit code check, it's merged now.

* Realized today that I need some vacation, put in for next week off.

* Quick doc cleanup [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/358)
  for the uefi-rs template readme.

* Taking a look at an
  [issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/73) about string
  conversion in uefi-rs. Some of the suggested changes have been made,
  but there's probably room for more conversion utilities and code
  cleanup. There's also quite a bit of discussion about improvements to
  `Write`ing UCS-2 strings, but I'm not clear on how necessary that is.

  I realized `CStr16::as_string` isn't needed since `to_string` is
  already automatically implemented, put up a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/357) to remove it.

  Now looking at removing some of the implicit conversions in the file
  system code. I've half convinced myself there's a bug in some unsafe
  code in `NamedFileProtocolInfo`, will have to check that more
  carefully. I might start by adding some more tests for the file code,
  since it looks like a lot of it isn't yet covered by uefi-test-runner.

* Took a little time to send messages to my senators about the EARN IT
  Act, wherein they are once again trying to let law enforcement spy on
  any ol' thing without even a pretense of oversight. More info at the
  [EFF](https://act.eff.org/action/stop-the-earn-it-act-to-save-our-privacy).

* Spent a while trying to figure out how to convert from HTML to PDF. I
  didn't end up finding a good option. There are plenty of tools that
  can do the basics of conversion: pandoc (with various "engines"),
  [Prince](https://www.princexml.com), wkhtmltopdf, chrome (with
  `--headless --print-to-pdf-no-header --print-to-pdf`), weasyprint, but
  all of these produce somewhat ugly output that doesn't match what the
  HTML looks like in the browser. Firefox's print-to-pdf actually
  produces very nice output, but as far as I can tell there's no way to
  turn off the headers and footers, and there's no way to generate a pdf
  from the command line
  [[bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1407238)].
  
  So, for now maybe the best way to generate a PDF is still LaTex, which
  I really did not expect to be the case. Fortunately it's a lot easier
  to work with LaTex than it used to be thanks to the amazing
  [tectonic](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic) project,
  but I really with I could use HTML. 
  
  I guess the real problem is that the format we really want doesn't
  exist: we want the locked formatting and single-file features of PDF,
  but without the incredible complexity of the PDF spec.
