* Made a couple fixes to the uefi-rs
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/355) that re-adds the
  exit code check, it's merged now.

* Realized today that I need some vacation, put in for next week off.

* Quick doc cleanup [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/358)
  for the uefi-rs template readme.

* Taking a look at an
  [issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/73) about string
  conversion in uefi-rs. Some of the suggested changes have been made,
  but there's probably room for more conversion utilities and code
  cleanup. There's also quite a bit of discussion about improvements to
  `Write`ing UCS-2 strings, but I'm not clear on how necessary that is.

  I realized `CStr16::as_string` isn't needed since `to_string` is
  already automatically implemented, put up a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/357) to remove it.

  Now looking at removing some of the implicit conversions in the file
  system code. I've half convinced myself there's a bug in some unsafe
  code in `NamedFileProtocolInfo`, will have to check that more
  carefully. I might start by adding some more tests for the file code,
  since it looks like a lot of it isn't yet covered by uefi-test-runner.
