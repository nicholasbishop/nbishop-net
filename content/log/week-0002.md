* Made a couple fixes to the uefi-rs
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/355) that re-adds the
  exit code check, it's merged now.

* Realized today that I need some vacation, put in for next week off.

* Taking a look at an
  [issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/73) about string
  conversion in uefi-rs. Some of the suggested changes have been made,
  but there's probably room for more conversion utilities and code
  cleanup. There's also quite a bit of discussion about improvements to
  `Write`ing UCS-2 strings, but I'm not clear on how necessary that is.
