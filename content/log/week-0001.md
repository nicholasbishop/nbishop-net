* Dependabot let me know that there's a new version of jsonwebtoken out,
  which [affects my github-app-auth crate](https://github.com/nicholasbishop/github-app-auth/pull/4).
  The automatic PR failed because I disabled default features on all the
  non-dev dependencies, and some new features need to be enabled.

  While I'm in there, thinking I might replace the `chrono` dep with `time`.
