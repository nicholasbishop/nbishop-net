* Dependabot let me know that there's a new version of jsonwebtoken out,
  which [affects my github-app-auth crate](https://github.com/nicholasbishop/github-app-auth/pull/4).
  The automatic PR failed because I disabled default features on all the
  non-dev dependencies, and some new features need to be enabled.

  While I'm in there, thinking I might replace the `chrono` dep with `time`.
  
* Hmm, turns out that `time` is actually quite a bit harder to use than
  `chrono`. There's a [book](https://time-rs.github.io/book/), but
  currently it's almost complete empty so it's hard to know where to
  look in the API. 

  I've posted a
  [question](https://github.com/time-rs/time/discussions/442) in the
  project's discussion board. I might try putting up some PRs to help
  fill in the docs more.

* A little work on the generator for this site to sort entries from new
  to old, and to add created/updated dates to pages. Then promptly
  removed the last-updated time, as it's not working correctly when
  rendering through github pages for some reason.
