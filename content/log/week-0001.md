* Dependabot let me know that there's a new version of jsonwebtoken out,
  which [affects my github-app-auth crate](https://github.com/nicholasbishop/github-app-auth/pull/4).
  The automatic PR failed because I disabled default features on all the
  non-dev dependencies, and some new features need to be enabled.

  While I'm in there, thinking I might replace the `chrono` dep with `time`.
  
* Hmm, turns out that `time` is actually quite a bit harder to use than
  `chrono`. There's a [book](https://time-rs.github.io/book/), but
  currently it's almost complete empty so it's hard to know where to
  look in the API. 

  I've posted a
  [question](https://github.com/time-rs/time/discussions/442) in the
  project's discussion board. I might try putting up some PRs to help
  fill in the docs more.

* A little work on the generator for this site to sort entries from new
  to old, and to add created/updated dates to pages. Then promptly
  removed the last-updated time, as it's not working correctly when
  rendering through github pages for some reason.

* Turns out that the github publish action was doing a shallow
  clone. Turning it into a full clone fixed the last-modified time.

* A TODO I've had for a while is to look into
  [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) and find out
  what that's all about. I have a personal text editor project called
  [emma](https://github.com/nicholasbishop/emma-editor), which I
  occasionally work on but is not what one might call
  functional. Currently it has some hacky syntax highlighting support
  using [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect), but maybe
  tree-sitter would be better since the syntax tree could be used for
  other operations too.
  
  Something that surprised me is that while tree-sitter seems to have
  good support for [incremental
  editing](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#editing),
  the associated
  [tree-sitter-highlight](https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter-highlight)
  library does not. There are a couple open threads on it
  ([discussion](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/discussions/1530),
  [issue](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/1540)), so
  hopefully that API will be improved at some point.

* Put up a uefi-rs [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/353)
  to add VM tests for Aarch64.

* Looking into adding support for 32-bit x86 UEFI to uefi-rs. The
  existing code seems to work fine, so just a matter of updating the
  xtask code to understand the `ia32` target and add it to the CI. The
  version of Ubuntu used on the github runner doesn't yet have an ia32
  OVMF package, but there are some unofficial nightlies here:
  https://github.com/retrage/edk2-nightly. Put up a quick
  [PR](https://github.com/retrage/edk2-nightly/pull/3) to fix broken
  ia32 links in that project's readme.
  
  And here's the [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/354)
  adding the ia32 target to uefi-rs.
