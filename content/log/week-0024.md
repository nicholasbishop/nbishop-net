## uefi-rs

* Opened a [bug](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/469) to
  remind myself to autodetect the OVMF files on Windows.
* Put up a PR with some minor fixes for the `#[entry]` macro error
  tests: <https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/471>
* Spent a while teasing out all the differences in where OVMF files get
  installed on different systems so we can do a better job of
  autodetecting that in the uefi-test-runner. Also some tweaks to the
  CLI interface, easier running of QEMU on Windows, and other little
  cleanups: <https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/474>

## Rust

* Opened a [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99765) to fix
  building the uefi targets in the rust compiler; it was incorrectly
  trying to build `std` which is not yet supported (although there is an
  active project to change that).
* There's a [new project](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99760)
  to work on moving the UEFI targets to tier 2! I've volunteered to help
  as a co-maintainer.
