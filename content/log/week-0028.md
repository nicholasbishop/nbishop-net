## uefi-rs

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/485) to fix an
  incorrect version in a deprecation attribute.
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/487) to enable
  [doc_auto_cfg](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/unstable-features.html#doc_auto_cfg-automatically-generate-doccfg) on docs.rs.
* Created minor releases of the three packages. We haven't done a
  release for a few months and some bug fixes have accrued. More details
  here: <https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/488>
  
## printf-compat

* [PR](https://github.com/lights0123/printf-compat/pull/2) to fix `cargo test`.
* [PR](https://github.com/lights0123/printf-compat/pull/3) to fix the CI trigger.

## gpt-disk-rs

* [PR](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/pull/70) to relax some
  version requirements.
* [PR](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/pull/71) to propagate the
  `std` feature down from `gpt_disk_io` and `gpt_disk_types`.
* [PR](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/pull/72) to enable
  `doc_auto_cfg` on docs.rs.
* [PR](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/pull/73) to gate `bytemuck`
  code behind a feature in `gpt_disk_types`, similar to what had
  previously been done in `uguid`.
* [PR](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/pull/77) to rework the CI
  so we don't end up with so many matrix-created jobs. The github
  actions behavior is kind of annoying here, because when marking a job
  as required in the branch settings you have to add every single
  matrix-created job individually.
* Released new versions of all three packages.

## Rust

* The UEFI targets started failing in latest nightly, filed an issue:
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/101071>
* Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101088) that
  should fix the UEFI compilation issue.
* Filed an issue for a bug I noticed with the `doc_auto_cfg` feature:
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/101129>
