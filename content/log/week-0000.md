_I'm trying an experiment of keeping some weekly notes here of what I'm
working on. I do something similar at `$dayjob`, where I've found it
helpful as a way of keeping track of ongoing work, as well as containing
helpful pointers when I need to dig up information on something that has
been paged out of my brain._

I've started looking into [improving release automation in
uefi-rs](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/325). Ultimately I
think it might be nice to do this through a manually-invoked github
action, but for starters I'm adding an xtask command that wraps
`cargo-release` and then merges the release commit through a PR (since
the `main` branch is protected from direct pushes).

I've already made a couple PRs to `cargo-release` in service of making
it work better for uefi-rs:
* [feat: Allow specifying build target](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/pull/396)
* [feat(cargo): Preserve dependent version
format](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/pull/397) 

I was very happy with how quick the review process was on those PRs, and
they got released right away which is neat.

The tricky thing about writing code to do a release is of course testing
it without accidentally pushing anything to crates.io or the github
repo. I'm thinking maybe I can use
[cargo-http-registry](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-http-registry) and
a scratch repo to make local testing easier.

Meanwhile, we're getting some lovely snow here!
