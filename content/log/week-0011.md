## uefi-rs

* While working on adding some more unit tests I found some undefined
  behavior using Miri. Filed an
  [issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/406).
* Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/407) to
  partially fix that UB, by avoiding use of `allocate_buffer` in the
  file info code.
* Found some potential UB in the file info code with
  `-Zmiri-tag-raw-pointers`, put up a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/408) to fix it.
* I'd like to enable `-Zmiri-tag-raw-pointers` in our Miri tests in
  general, but it's catching some issues with `DevicePath`. This one is
  tricky because unlike most protocols, `DevicePath` is really
  unsized. But we don't currently implement it that way.

## Rust

* I've been using Miri more in uefi-rs to test our unsafe code, which we
  have quite a lot of. One issue I've had is that I find myself guessing
  a lot as to what Miri is trying to tell me. The error messages are
  relatively terse, and while a lot has been written about stacked
  borrows, it's not clear what the best resource to read is. As a first
  step to improving this situation I filed an
  [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/2066) in the Miri
  repo suggesting adding documentation for Miri's output to the
  readme. Even just documenting the notation used in the output would be
  a good start.
