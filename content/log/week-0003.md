* Taking the whole week off from `$dayjob`. Since we are still in covid
  times this will be a staycation, but still very pleasant to have more
  time to relax.
  
* Continuing to work on updating my resume. After last week's adventures
  in HTML â†’ PDF conversion I decided to stick with the LaTeX format of
  my resume that I've been using for many years.

* Upstreamed a [small
  fix](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/agd5f/linux/-/commit/47e37b572afbf65be138a1bc07441b32df407bf3)
  in Linux for the iMac12,1 backlight. It's only a couple lines of diff,
  but it feels nice to fix up some old (but not *that* old) hardware to
  benefit anyone still using it.

* Experimenting with some kind of consistent buffer API in uefi-rs. A
  consistent pattern that comes up a lot is that UEFI has a function to
  read data into a buffer (often, but not always, a `u8` slice), and if
  the buffer is not big enough it will return `BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`. In
  some cases we have manually wrapped such functions to provide a more
  convenient API that uses a `Vec` as the buffer so that we can resize
  it as needed until it's big enough. Since allocation is optional in
  uefi-rs, the latter interface is hidden behind the `exts` feature.

  It would be nice if we had a way to do all that without the manual
  boilerplate. I'm experimenting with having a `Buffer` trait that can
  be backed by either an array or a `Vec`, and seeing how far I can get
  with that.
