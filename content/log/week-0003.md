* Taking the whole week off from `$dayjob`. Since we are still in covid
  times this will be a staycation, but still very pleasant to have more
  time to relax.
  
* Continuing to work on updating my resume. After last week's adventures
  in HTML → PDF conversion I decided to stick with the LaTeX format of
  my resume that I've been using for many years.

* Upstreamed a [small
  fix](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/agd5f/linux/-/commit/47e37b572afbf65be138a1bc07441b32df407bf3)
  in Linux for the iMac12,1 backlight. It's only a couple lines of diff,
  but it feels nice to fix up some old (but not *that* old) hardware to
  benefit anyone still using it.

* Experimenting with some kind of consistent buffer API in uefi-rs. A
  consistent pattern that comes up a lot is that UEFI has a function to
  read data into a buffer (often, but not always, a `u8` slice), and if
  the buffer is not big enough it will return `BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`. In
  some cases we have manually wrapped such functions to provide a more
  convenient API that uses a `Vec` as the buffer so that we can resize
  it as needed until it's big enough. Since allocation is optional in
  uefi-rs, the latter interface is hidden behind the `exts` feature.

  It would be nice if we had a way to do all that without the manual
  boilerplate. I'm experimenting with having a `Buffer` trait that can
  be backed by either an array or a `Vec`, and seeing how far I can get
  with that.

* One area of uefi-rs that has consistently tripped me up is
  `uefi::Result`, which tries to cleanly separate errors from warnings
  (UEFI packs both of these into the `EFI_STATUS` enum.) I'm going to
  write up a proposal to simplify this type and see what people think.

* RFC for removing `uefi::Completion` is now up:
  <https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/360>
  
  Also put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/361)
  that implements the change. +179/−395 :)

* [ChromeOS
  Flex](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/google-turns-old-macs-pcs-into-chromebooks-with-chrome-os-flex)
  is now publicly announced! We worked very hard on it, please clap.
  
* Some
  [dicussion](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/360#issuecomment-1043518980)
  on the RFC for removing `uefi::Completion`. Plan is to give it some
  more time so that people have a chance to notice it and comment.

* Spent a little time learning about [OP-TEE](https://www.op-tee.org/)
  in order to respond to a uefi-rs
  [question](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/362#issuecomment-1044788622). Seems
  like client applications wouldn't need to be directly supported in
  uefi-rs, but rather a separate complementary crate. Could be wrong though.

* Put up a uefi-rs [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/363)
  to remove some implicit string conversion. Also increased the test
  coverage a little bit.
