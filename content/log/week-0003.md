* Taking the whole week off from `$dayjob`. Since we are still in covid
  times this will be a staycation, but still very pleasant to have more
  time to relax.
  
* Continuing to work on updating my resume. After last week's adventures
  in HTML â†’ PDF conversion I decided to stick with the LaTeX format of
  my resume that I've been using for many years.

* Upstreamed a [small
  fix](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/agd5f/linux/-/commit/47e37b572afbf65be138a1bc07441b32df407bf3)
  in Linux for the iMac12,1 backlight. It's only a couple lines of diff,
  but it feels nice to fix up some old (but not *that* old) hardware to
  benefit anyone still using it.
