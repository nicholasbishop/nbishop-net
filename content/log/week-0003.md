* Taking the whole week off from `$dayjob`. Since we are still in covid
  times this will be a staycation, but still very pleasant to have more
  time to relax.
  
* Continuing to work on updating my resume. After last week's adventures
  in HTML -> PDF conversion I decided to stick with the LaTeX format of
  my resume that I've been using for many years.
