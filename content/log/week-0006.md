## uefi-rs

* Doing some [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/386)
  review, there's a mysterious failuring on the aarch64 VM.
  
  Turned out it was just a bad pointer. Suprising that it only failed on
  aarch64!

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/388) to add bitflag
  semantics to GPT partition attributes.

* We've merged the [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/361)
  that implements the
  [uefi::Result simplification RFC](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/360).
  
  I'm pretty pleased with that cleanup, I think it will make things
  significantly simpler for users of the library, and even improve
  correctness in some cases.
