## Rust

* My second round of UEFI ABI fixes [`compiler_builtins`
  PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/pull/486) was
  merged and put in a release, so I put up another
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100380) to update rustc to
  the latest. Hopefully all UEFI intrinsics are all good now.
