## uefi-rs

* Put up an alternative
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/481) for
  `try_trait_v2` that puts it behind a feature flag instead of dropping
  it entirely. I think either would be a reasonable solution, mainly I
  just want to avoid released versions breaking if and when the
  `try_trait_v2` API changes again.
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/482) to relax version
  requirements. This is useful when building in restrictive/sandboxed
  environments where the latest versions of packages might not be easily
  available.
* Updated the [`open_protocol_exclusive`
  PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/478) in response to
  some review comments. The `entry` macro now has a much more detailed
  docstring, and some other docs and messages have been improved.

## RustCrypto

* [PR](https://github.com/RustCrypto/formats/pull/702) to fix some
  incorrect links in the `der` crate.
