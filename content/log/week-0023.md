## Rust

* Nightly has started failing during linking for the
  `x86_64-unknown-uefi` target. An
  [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/issues/479) was
  filed in `compiler-builtins` for this, but I bisected it to a change
  in the rust repo. A
  [revert](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99674) for the
  breaking change has already been created, so hopefully nothing further
  needed there.
