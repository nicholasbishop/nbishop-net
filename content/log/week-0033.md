## Rust

* The [MCP](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/555) to
  raise the UEFI targets to tier 2 has been approved.
  
* The corresponding [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103933)
  to implement the MCP has been approved.

* The [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101703) for adding
  UEFI CI has been merged. Should lead to fewer surprise breakages on
  nightly, although for now the CI coverage is still pretty minimal
  (e.g. it only covers `x86_64`, and doesn't cover more "advanced"
  things like alloc support).
  
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104020) to limit the
  `efiapi` calling convention to supported arches. This is one of the two
  remaining known issues in the
  [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65815)
  for that feature.
  
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104077) to treat `efiapi`
  as `aapcs` on ARM.

## uefi-rs

* Put up a quite large
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/547) to flesh out our
  device path node API a lot. All node types are now supported, and
  there's a new builder API for creating new device paths. This is a big
  step up from having to construct paths manually, byte by byte.
