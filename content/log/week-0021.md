## uefi-rs

* Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/460) to make
  almost all protocol opening happen through the `open_protocol`
  method. The other two methods for opening protocols (`handle_protocol`
  and `locate_protocol`) are now marked as `unsafe` and deprecated.

  There's still some more safety work to do with `open_protocol` -- if
  the protocol isn't opened in exclusive mode, or if the agent parameter
  isn't set correctly, UB could still result. But this change is a good
  step in the right direction.
