## uefi-rs

* Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/460) to make
  almost all protocol opening happen through the `open_protocol`
  method. The other two methods for opening protocols (`handle_protocol`
  and `locate_protocol`) are now marked as `unsafe` and deprecated.

  There's still some more safety work to do with `open_protocol` -- if
  the protocol isn't opened in exclusive mode, or if the agent parameter
  isn't set correctly, UB could still result. But this change is a good
  step in the right direction.

* Created a few PRs for the next edition of [_This Month in Rust
  OSDev_](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pull/104):
  * [Fix location of MOROS addition](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pull/107)
  * [Add section on gpt-disk-rs](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pull/108)
  * [Add June changes for uefi-rs](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pull/109)

## Rust

I think I finally found a fix for the `u128` division
[bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86494) on
`x86_64-unknown-uefi`. Put up a
[PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/pull/475) in the
`compiler-builtins` repo.
