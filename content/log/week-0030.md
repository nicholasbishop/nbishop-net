## uefi-rs

* Released new versions of all the crates:
  <https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/501>. There are some
  significant API changes around opening and using protocols in this
  release, so we waited a bit since the last set of releases to avoid
  too much churn. I think the end result is pretty good though, the
  library is both safer and easier to use now.
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/514) to improve the
  return types of the methods for converting between `DevicePath`s and
  text.

## rustup

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/3067) to improve
  rustup's documentation of `rust-toolchain.toml`.

## gpt-disk-rs

* [PR](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/pull/80) to add an
  `AlignedGuid` type, followed by a
  [PR](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/pull/84) to undo an
  accidental change to `Guid`'s repr.
* I realized there were some flaws with the way `uguid`'s macros were
  implemented. Some fixes in
  <https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/pull/86>, not yet released.
