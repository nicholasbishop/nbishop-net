* Quick [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/364) to make
  running tests easier in uefi-rs.

* Getting back to looking at the file info code in uefi-rs, I did find
  some bugs and things to improve. There were too many things to do it
  all in one PR, so I've started out with a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/365) containing one
  fix that adds unit tests. Once that's merged I'll follow up with more
  cleanups and improvements.
  
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/366) to add more
  string equality impls for `CStr16` and `CString16`.

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/367) to expand the
  documentation of the `Align` trait in uefi-rs. It took me a bit to
  understand exactly why this trait is needed, hopefully this doc update
  will help someone in the future get it more quickly.

* Previous set of uefi-rs PRs got merged, put up a new
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/368) to remove some
  more implicit string conversions.

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/369) to add a
  changelog to uefi-rs. Covers change relevant to end users going back
  to the 0.14.0 release.

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/370) to add a small
  `LoadedImage` test.

* Wrote up some more
  [thoughts](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/359#issuecomment-1051587214)
  in an issue about the safety of handles in uefi-rs. Definitely a bit
  tricky to properly maintain guarantees in the UEFI environment.

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/375) to clean up the
  `LoadedImage` API and make it safer.

* Did some learning about combining characters in unicode. There was an
  issue in uefi-rs suggesting that we might want to be smarter about
  where we split text output since splitting before a combining
  character might not render properly. Turns out that, at least on the
  two UEFI implementations I tested on, they don't render combining
  characters at all. So that makes the issue moot, which is good because
  fixing it properly seemed pretty tricky.
  
  Left more details in a long
  [comment](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/73#issuecomment-1053727614)
  and closed out the issue.
