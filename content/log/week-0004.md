* Quick [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/364) to make
  running tests easier in uefi-rs.

* Getting back to looking at the file info code in uefi-rs, I did find
  some bugs and things to improve. There were too many things to do it
  all in one PR, so I've started out with a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/365) containing one
  fix that adds unit tests. Once that's merged I'll follow up with more
  cleanups and improvements.
  
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/366) to add more
  string equality impls for `CStr16` and `CString16`.
