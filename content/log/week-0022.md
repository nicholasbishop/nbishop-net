## uefi-rs

* Rustup 1.25 made some changes to the environment that commands are run
  in, including `cargo run`, which caused our xtask commands to
  break. Fixed by unsetting some variables and modifying the `PATH` (the
  latter fix is needed for Windows specifically).
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/466)

## Rust

* The Rustup changes mentioned above were discussed in
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3031>. I contributed to
  that issue a bit, and then filed
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3036> for the Windows
  `PATH` problem.
