## uefi-rs

* Rustup 1.25 made some changes to the environment that commands are run
  in, including `cargo run`, which caused our xtask commands to
  break. Fixed by unsetting some variables and modifying the `PATH` (the
  latter fix is needed for Windows specifically).

* In response to this
  [issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/461), I worked on
  adding support for running VMs under Windows without requiring
  WSL. (Incidentally, the issue suggests this is a regression from the
  `build.py` script, but I'm reasonably sure that isn't the case; that
  script had Unix assumptions baked in too.) I had some difficulty
  getting this to work due to the way that Windows named pipes are
  handled in QEMU. The whole process gets stuck if there's any trailing
  data after a JSON message sent to qmp (in our case, a trailing
  newline). Figuring that out took a long detour through building QEMU
  locally, adding in lots of debug messages, and incorrectly thinking it
  was a bug in QEMU's coroutine usage. The working implementation ends
  up being pretty simple though:

## Rust

* The Rustup changes mentioned above were discussed in
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3031>. I contributed to
  that issue a bit, and then filed
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3036> for the Windows
  `PATH` problem.
