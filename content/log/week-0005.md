* Spent a while staring at the documentation for
  [`addr_of_mut!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/macro.addr_of_mut.html)
  before finally deciding there's a mistake in the description of what
  is safe. Filed a rust-lang documentation
  [bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/94473), we'll see what
  they say.

* There's a [bug](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/80) in
  uefi-rs about a mis-aligned field that's been open for a long time. I
  think I've sorted out all the alignment issues while avoiding any
  UB. Put up a largish
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/377) with the fixes
  and also adds some new tests to hopefully prevent things from going
  wrong in the future.

* Quick [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/378) to fix some
  UB in a doctest caught by Miri.

* Did a little research into a long-standing issue with a multiprocessor
  test that doesn't work in the uefi-rs CI. Left a
  [comment](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/103#issuecomment-1057614549)
  with some notes, probably have to ask the OVMF people about it.

* Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/381) to add
  support for running some uefi tests under Miri.

* Put together a bug report for EDK2 about the multiprocessor protocol
  reporting the wrong number of CPUs when running under QEMU without KVM
  (works fine with KVM): https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/87303

* Took another [stab](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/383) at
  filling out the `load_image` method in uefi-rs.
