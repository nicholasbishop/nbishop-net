* Spent a while staring at the documentation for
  [`addr_of_mut!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/macro.addr_of_mut.html)
  before finally deciding there's a mistake in the description of what
  is safe. Filed a rust-lang documentation
  [bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/94473), we'll see what
  they say.
