* Spent a while staring at the documentation for
  [`addr_of_mut!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/macro.addr_of_mut.html)
  before finally deciding there's a mistake in the description of what
  is safe. Filed a rust-lang documentation
  [bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/94473), we'll see what
  they say.

* There's a [bug](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/80) in
  uefi-rs about a mis-aligned field that's been open for a long time. I
  think I've sorted out all the alignment issues while avoiding any
  UB. Put up a largish
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/377) with the fixes
  and also adds some new tests to hopefully prevent things from going
  wrong in the future.
