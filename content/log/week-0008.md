## Rust

* Started writing some [notes](notes-rust-uefi-division.html) on
  investigating a bug in Rust with division on the x86_64 UEFI target.

## uefi-rs

* Back in [Week 0003](log-week-0003.html) I started looking at a generic
  buffer interface. I paused that to work on the removal of
  [`uefi::Completion`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/360),
  but now that that's done I'm resuming buffer work. Some rough goals:
  * Generic interface that can be used for all UEFI interfaces that take
    a buffer. Underlying type is some kind of contiguous slice of `T`.
  * Avoid needing multiple wrapper methods for the same underlying UEFI
    interface. E.g. we don't want one method that takes a slice, another
    that takes a MaybeUninit slice, and another that dynamically
    allocates.
  * Make it hard or impossible to accidentally use the wrong length of
    the buffer. Currently it's easy to pass in a slice of zeroed memory,
    get UEFI to fill in the first N elements, and then end up using the
    full original slice, which may have junk data (initialized in the
    Rust sense, but not containing real data) at the end.
  * For the dynamic allocation case, allow capping the size to avoid
    unbounded memory usage.
  * Make it easy to get alignment correct. This comes up for example
    with the file info types, which are DSTs.
