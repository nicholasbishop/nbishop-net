## uefi-rs

* Realized that I missing something very important in the
  [`uefi::Result` simplification PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/361):
  warning statuses were incorrectly being treated as success instead of error.
  
  Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/389) to fix
  that and add a unit test to ensure the correctness.
