## uefi-rs

* Realized that I missing something very important in the
  [`uefi::Result` simplification PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/361):
  warning statuses were incorrectly being treated as success instead of error.
  
  Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/389) to fix
  that and add a unit test to ensure the correctness.

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/392) to add a lot more
  file system testing. This builds a disk image entirely using Rust
  libraries (fatfs and mbrman), which I didn't previously know we could
  do. A nice alternative compared to invoking a bunch of command-line
  tools.
