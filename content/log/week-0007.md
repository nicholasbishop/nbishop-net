## uefi-rs

* Realized that I missing something very important in the
  [`uefi::Result` simplification PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/361):
  warning statuses were incorrectly being treated as success instead of error.
  
  Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/389) to fix
  that and add a unit test to ensure the correctness.

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/392) to add a lot more
  file system testing. This builds a disk image entirely using Rust
  libraries ([fatfs](https://crates.io/crates/fatfs) and
  [mbrman](https://crates.io/crates/mbrman)), which I didn't previously
  know we could do. A nice alternative to invoking a bunch of
  command-line tools.

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/393) to drop some
  badges from the readme. Ironically it seems that
  [isitmaintained.com](https://isitmaintained.com) is 
  [not maintained](https://github.com/mnapoli/IsItMaintained) since 2018.

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/395) to make the
  `Time` type easier to work with.

## Rust

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95117) to clarify what you
  can't do with the `addr_of`/`addr_of_mut` macros. I had previously
  opened an [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/94473)
  expressing my confusion, it was pointed out that I didn't understand
  the UB rules correctly. Hopefully my PR can help the next person who
  is confusedâ€¦
