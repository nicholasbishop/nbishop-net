## Rust

* The `i686-unknown-uefi` test in uefi-rs started failing with latest
  nightly. I did a quick bisect and filed an
  [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/96498) in the Rust
  repo, which was very quickly fixed.

## uefi-rs

* After a lot of revisions, I finally finished my [rework of the
  `DevicePath` API](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/421). The
  original motivation for this change was getting tests to pass under
  Miri with `-Zmiri-tag-raw-pointers` enabled, but also ended up with
  (IMO) a much-improved interface by separating `DevicePath` into
  several types.

* I've been experimenting with some very unfinished testing that has
  already uncovered a few minor issues, put up fixes for a couple:
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/422),
