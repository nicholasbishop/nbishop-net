## Rust

* Noticed that the CI in uefi-rs is broken
  ([bug](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/397)). The problem
  occurs when compiling fatfs. I spent a while reducing that down to a
  much smaller repro and files a Rust bug:
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95538>

## uefi-rs

* [Worked around]( https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/399) the
  above Rust issue by making the CI run xtask with the stable toolchain.
