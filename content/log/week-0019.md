## gpt-disk-rs

* Released some more minor improvements to `uguid`.
  [0.7.0 Changelog](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/blob/main/uguid/CHANGELOG.md#070)
  
* Improved the `Error` type in `uguid`. That was the last API change I
  wanted to make, so released `uguid`
  [1.0.0](https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs/blob/main/uguid/CHANGELOG.md#100).

## uefi-rs

* Fixed an incorrect pointer parameter in the Rng
  protocol. [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/447). This
  was reported in https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/446, and
  interestingly it only crashes when compiling in release mode. Not sure
  why that is.

* Cleaned up some unused code related to `ucs2`
  Errors. [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/450)
