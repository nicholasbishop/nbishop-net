## uefi-rs

* Wrote up a
  [comment](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/458#issuecomment-1173188255)
  describing how to set the mode with GOP. The API is a little
  confusing, and also different from the C API described in the UEFI
  Specification.

* I've started writing a uefi-rs guide using
  [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook). 
  Here's the current WIP: <https://nicholasbishop.github.io/uefi-rs>.
  [Tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/459).
