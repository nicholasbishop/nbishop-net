## uefi-rs

* Put together a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/404)
  that starts to make device paths a little easier to work with. Making
  a convenient wrapper for file path media device paths turned out to be
  tricky because they are packed structures. That means we can't use our
  normal string type, because it requires a reference which would be UB
  to create from an unalighed pointer. Added a new `UnalignedCStr16`
  type to solve this in a a hopefully not too ugly way.
