## uefi-rs

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/502) to use
  `rust-toolchain.toml` in the uefi-rs project. I didn't previously know
  about that config. Using it simplifies xtask, the build instructions
  for the template, and the github actions. It also makes it easy for us
  to temporarily pin to a non-current nightly version when latest
  nightly is broken.

## Rust

* The uefi-rs CI started failing again in latest nightly:
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101413>. Did a bisect that
  pointed at a recent change to the UEFI targets which changed the
  relocation model from PIC to static. I'm not entirely clear on why the
  change is breaking, but went ahead and put up a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101413) to revert that
  change for now.
