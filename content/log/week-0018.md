## gpt-disk-rs

* Split the `Guid` type out of `gpt_disk_types` and into its own crate:
  [`uguid`](https://crates.io/crates/uguid). The existing GUID crates
  don't quite do the same thing, and since the `Guid` type is pretty
  broadly useful (UEFI, GPT, Microsoft Windows) I think it's good to
  have it in its own crate so it can easily be reused.

## uefi-rs

* Quick [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/444) to fix the
  CI after `clap` deprecated a bunch of stuff. That fix was quickly
  superceded by a
  [better one](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/445) though.

  I think what `clap` tried to do with smoothing the upgrade path via
  deprecations was a reasonable and interesting experiment, but
  ultimately it clearly didn't work out because too many projects don't
  want to see such warnings, even if non-fatal. I guess maybe a better
  upgrade guide could have helped, but in the end it doesn't seem like
  there's much advantage there over just waiting until a major version
  bump to make the change without using deprecations.
