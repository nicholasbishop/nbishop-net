## uefi-rs

* Quick [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/444) to fix the
  CI after `clap` deprecated a bunch of stuff. That fix was quickly
  superceded by a
  [better one](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/445) though.

  I think what `clap` tried to do with smoothing the upgrade path via
  deprecations was a reasonable and interesting experiment, but
  ultimately it clearly didn't work out because too many projects don't
  want to see such warnings, even if non-fatal. I guess maybe a better
  upgrade guide could have helped, but in the end it doesn't seem like
  there's much advantage there over just waiting until a major version
  bump to make the change without using deprecations.
