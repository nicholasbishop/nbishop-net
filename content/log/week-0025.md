## gpt-disk-rs

* A developer contacted me to suggest changing the license from just
  Apache-2.0 to Apache-2.0 or MIT. This improves compatibility with
  GPLv2 and is in alignment with much of the Rust ecosystem. That change
  has now been made and new versions of the crates have been
  released. (Took me a few tries to get the license README links
  correct, so ended up with a few extra dot releases of `uguid`, but
  should be all good now.)
  
## uefi-rs

* Spent some time testing and reviewing a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/467) that adds support
  for a couple more disk protocols. The nonblocking stuff was a bit tricky.
* Finally put up a PR for
  [`open_protocol_exclusive`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/478),
  which I think will provide about the best interface possible for
  safely opening UEFI protocols given the limitations of the UEFI
  design. (I think ideally UEFI would have a reference count on open
  protocols, rather than just exclusive vs free-for-all, but that's
  outside the scope of what I think we can accomplish in uefi-rs.)
* Put up a [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/479) to
  remove use of the unstable `try_trait_v2` feature. This has a small
  impact on the API, but I think removing it is the right thing to do to
  avoid potential future breakage on nightly due to the `Try` API still
  being under discussion.

## Rust

* Opened another [`compiler_builtins`
  PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/pull/486) to fix
  some more UEFI intrinsics. For some reason the ABI intrinsics that
  convert from i128/u128 to f32/f64 are different depending on whether
  softfloat is enabled.
* Opened a [Rust PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100117) to
  update the `cc` crate to latest. That fixes some issues with compiling
  `compiler_builtins` for the UEFI targets.
* Opened a [Rust PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100038) to
  add documentation for the `no-std` target build option. Since
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99765> was merged this option
  isn't needed for UEFI anymore, but can hopefully help future people
  trying to build for new targets that don't support `std` (until such
  time as <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99765> is fixed).
* Opened a [Rust PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100218) to
  update the `compiler_builtins` crate to latest. This will fix some
  (but not all) UEFI intrinsic ABI issues.
