# gpt-disk-rs

* A developer contacted me to suggest changing the license from just
  Apache-2.0 to Apache-2.0 or MIT. This improves compatibility with
  GPLv2 and is in alignment with much of the Rust ecosystem. That change
  has now been made and new versions of the crates have been
  released. (Took me a few tries to get the license README links
  correct, so ended up with a few extra dot releases of `uguid`, but
  should be all good now.)
