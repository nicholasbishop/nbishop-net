## gpt-disk-rs

* I've been working recently on some crates for working with GPT disks,
  and today I finished the process of getting them open sourced:
  <https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs>
  
  The `gpt_disk_types` crate provides all the basic types that are
  defined by the GPT portion of the UEFI specification (GPT header,
  partition entries, protective MBR, etc.) The `gpt_disk_io` crate
  extends that with an abstract interface for reading and writing to a
  block device, along with a few concrete implementations for working
  with slices and files.

  The docs.rs queue was very backed up at the time I released (it took
  about 12 hours to get to my crates). Done a couple publishes since
  then and it's been very quick though, so seems to have been a
  temporary blip.

## uefi-rs

* Quick [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/442) to fix a
  mistake in the test for `query_variable_info`.

* Another quick [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/443),
  this removes `exts::allocate_buffer` because it can cause undefined
  behavior.
