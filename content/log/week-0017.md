## gpt-disk-rs

* I've been working recently on some crates for working with GPT disks,
  and today I finished the process of getting them open sourced:
  <https://github.com/google/gpt-disk-rs>
  
  The `gpt_disk_types` crate provides all the basic types that are
  defined by the GPT portion of the UEFI specification (GPT header,
  partition entries, protective MBR, etc.) The `gpt_disk_io` crate
  extends that with an abstract interface for reading and writing to a
  block device, along with a few concrete implementations for working
  with slices and files.

  The docs.rs queue seems very backed up. I published the crates hours
  ago, at which point they were at around position 190 in the queue, now
  they are at around 150. Not sure if this is normal for new crates or
  what.
