## Rust

* The [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101703) for adding
  UEFI CI got some more comments, updated it to be part of an existing
  CI test group. Ran into the issue where old QEMU crashes with OVMF,
  but I think it should be fine for this test.

## Rustup

* Minor update to my [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/3067)
  for expanding the toolchain.toml docs.
