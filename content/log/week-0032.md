## Rust

* The [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101703) for adding
  UEFI CI got some more comments, updated it to be part of an existing
  CI test group. Ran into the issue where old QEMU crashes with OVMF,
  but I think it should be fine for this test.

## Rustup

* Minor update to my [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/3067)
  for expanding the toolchain.toml docs.

## uefi-rs

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/516) to switch back to
  latest nightly.
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/517) to add a CI job
  to test building with an older nightly so that we can be more
  intentional about when the required nightly version changes.
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/518) to add some
  address type aliases and fix the definition of `AllocateType` on
  `i686-unknown-uefi`.
* We got an issue a while ago about better supporting vscode+rust
  analyzer. This was something I hadn't thought about before; I don't
  use rust-analyzer or any particularly fancy IDE stuff myself. (Just as
  a matter of personal preference I don't like when docs pop up over the
  code, or red squigglies show up under code that I'm working on, or the
  struggle to get it working with any larger project that inevitably has
  some kind of custom config.) However, I know others like these tools
  so I very much want to support their use case as well as we can. I
  spent a little time figuring out how to get vscode+rust analyzer set
  up to test it out, and documented some issues I saw and solutions to
  some of them:
