## Rust

* The [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101703) for adding
  UEFI CI got some more comments, updated it to be part of an existing
  CI test group. Ran into the issue where old QEMU crashes with OVMF,
  but I think it should be fine for this test.

## Rustup

* Minor update to my [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/3067)
  for expanding the toolchain.toml docs.

## uefi-rs

* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/516) to switch back to
  latest nightly.
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/517) to add a CI job
  to test building with an older nightly so that we can be more
  intentional about when the required nightly version changes.
* [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/518) to add some
  address type aliases and fix the definition of `AllocateType` on
  `i686-unknown-uefi`.
