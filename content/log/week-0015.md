## uefi-rs

* I noticed that we are allowing some UEFI-2.0+-only functions to be
  called without checking the table version. Put up a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/436) to fix that, and
  along the way constify some methods of `Revision` and add constants
  for all the UEFI revisions.

* A user pointed out that although compiling uefi-rs works just fine
  under Windows (including outside of WSL), using our `cargo xtask`
  tools does not work. This is due to dependencies on the `nix` crate,
  used for some VM testing operations. Put up a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/438) to add some
  conditional compilation so that xtask builds under Windows. The PR
  also adds a CI job to ensure it keeps working.
