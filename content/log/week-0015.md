## uefi-rs

* I noticed that we are allowing some UEFI-2.0+-only functions to be
  called without checking the table version. Put up a
  [PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/436) to fix that, and
  along the way constify some methods of `Revision` and add constants
  for all the UEFI revisions.
