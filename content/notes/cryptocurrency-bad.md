Here's my unnuanced take: cryptocurrencies and NFTs are bad.

* They are being used by scammers to take advantage of people.
* People who don't know a lot about technology are being scammed by
  crypto and losing more than they can afford to.
* Cryptocurrencies are bad for the environment.

People who understand technology have a responsibility to speak up and
let others know that cryptocurrencies and NFTs are not safe.
