      <p><em>I'm trying an experiment of keeping some weekly notes here of what I'm
working on. I do something similar at <code>$dayjob</code>, where I've found it
helpful as a way of keeping track of ongoing work, as well as containing
helpful pointers when I need to dig up information on something that has
been paged out of my brain.</em></p>
<p>I've started looking into <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/325">improving release automation in
uefi-rs</a>. Ultimately I
think it might be nice to do this through a manually-invoked github
action, but for starters I'm adding an xtask command that wraps
<code>cargo-release</code> and then merges the release commit through a PR (since
the <code>main</code> branch is protected from direct pushes).</p>
<p>I've already made a couple PRs to <code>cargo-release</code> in service of making
it work better for uefi-rs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/pull/396">feat: Allow specifying build target</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/pull/397">feat(cargo): Preserve dependent version
format</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I was very happy with how quick the review process was on those PRs, and
they got released right away which is neat.</p>
