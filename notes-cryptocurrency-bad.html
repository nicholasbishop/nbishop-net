      <p>Here's my unnuanced take: cryptocurrencies and NFTs are bad.</p>
<p>I'm posting this not to add anything to the discource about
cryptocurrencies, but because I believe that software developers have a
professional responsibility to speak out against technologies that hurt
people. We have a responsibility to speak out about a lot of other
problems too of course, but this topic seems particularly important
right now since silence on our part will allow cryptocurrency to gain
even more of a hold in the public's mind as a legimate, if young,
technology. It is not legitimate though; it is used to scam people and
guzzle energy.</p>
