      <p>Here's my unnuanced take: cryptocurrencies and NFTs are bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are being used by scammers to take advantage of people.</li>
<li>People who don't know a lot about technology are being scammed by
crypto and losing more than they can afford to.</li>
<li>Cryptocurrencies are bad for the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>People who understand technology have a responsibility to speak up and
let others know that cryptocurrencies and NFTs are not safe.</p>
